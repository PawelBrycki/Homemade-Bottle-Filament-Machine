Some day my dad was watching YouTube and find the film about homemade filaments for 3d printing. He told me about it and inspired to do my own machine that could make a filament by bottles. The build was inspired on Russian YouTuber and I used his 3D projects. The project was finished some years ago, so when I find the Russian YouTuber I will link his channel.
